- 📱 **Poor UX**: Complex addresses, QR codes, and multiple steps
- 💳 **Limited Access**: 1.7 billion people globally lack banking access

### The Web3 Payment Paradox

Even in the crypto space, payments remain complex:

- 🔗 **Long Addresses**: `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b8D4C9db96C4b4d8b6` - impossible to remember
- 💰 **Gas Fees**: Ethereum network congestion makes small payments uneconomical
- 🏦 **No Business Tools**: Lack of payment links, invoicing, and business features
- 📊 **No Analytics**: No insights into payment patterns or customer behavior
